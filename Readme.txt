*Installation

Follow these steps to get your project set up locally:

*Clone the repository:


Copy code

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

*Install Composer dependencies:

Copy code
composer install

*Copy .env.example to .env and configure:


Copy code

cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

Update .env with your database configuration and any other necessary settings.

*Run migrations and seeders:


Copy code
php artisan migrate --seed

This will create the necessary tables and seed them with sample data (if you have seeders defined).
